# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this project, we will analyze the historical trip data of Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently and provide insights for designing a new marketing strategy.

## Ask
Our primary task is to answer the following questions:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Data Sources
- Cyclistic's historical trip data (from Jan 2023 to Dec 2023) is used for analysis. [Download Here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) | [License Information](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
- Each dataset is a CSV (comma-separated values) file containing details of every ride logged by Cyclistic customers.

## Data Cleaning and Formatting
The cleaning process involves converting data types, handling missing values, and creating new columns for analysis. Some key steps include:
- Converting station IDs to strings
- Dropping rows with missing values
- Converting datetime columns to the appropriate format
- Calculating ride time and distance
- Mapping month numbers to month names

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves analyzing various aspects of the data to uncover insights. Key visualizations include:
- Total ridership by user type
- Average trip duration and distance
- Hourly, daily, and monthly usage patterns
- Preferences for different ride types

## Key Observations
Based on the analysis, several key observations were made, including:
- Membership Advantage: Cyclistic members account for a significantly higher number of trips compared to casual riders.
- Ride Duration and Distance: Casual riders tend to have longer average trip durations and cover greater distances than Cyclistic members.
- Peak Usage Hours: Both user groups exhibit a peak in activity around 5 PM.
- Weekend Popularity: Both users experience their busiest periods on weekends.

## Recommendations
To address the findings, several recommendations were made, including:
- Implement targeted promotions for casual riders on weekdays to encourage more uniform usage.
- Introduce exclusive benefits for Cyclistic members, such as priority access during peak hours.
- Expand membership options by introducing short-term plans like one-week or one-month memberships.

## Conclusion
The Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study provides valuable insights into user behavior and usage patterns. By understanding the differences between casual riders and annual members, Cyclistic can tailor its marketing strategies to attract and retain customers effectively.
